## Prerequisites
* CSCI102 or Instructor Permission
* Students should be familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS and be able to create a basic multi-page website. 
* Students are also expected to be familiar with the following concepts:
  * Lists
  * Tables
  * Basic CSS styling (using an external stylesheet)
  * Basic familiarity with HTML forms. 



## Workload
This course will require approximately 15 hours of "homework" per week. Students must have access to a personal computer or attend the on-campus computer lab. The workload is as follows:

### Weekly Reading Assignments (ungraded)
Although ungraded, keeping up with the weekly reading is required. Students who fail to read the weekly chapters will score poorly on the weekly quizzes and will not be able to complete the weekly case studies (see below). 

### Weekly Case Studies (10pts each)
Nearly every week there will also be a Case Study assignment where students will be building JavaJam - a responsive (mobile friendly) website for a coffee shop. These case study assignments come directly from the book. Students who have read book should have no trouble completing the case study at the end of the chapter. 

### Weekly Assignments (10pts each)
There will be at least 1 weekly assignment where students will utilize the skills they learn from the lecture videos and slides. 

### Weekly Quizzes (10pts each)
Quiz questions come directly from the weekly reading. You must read the book to be successful!

### Final Project (25pts for proposal, 100pts for final project. 125pts total)
Students will be required to build a real HTML5/CSS3 website for a local business client. They will submit a final project proposal at the beginning of the quarter (25pts). At the end of the semester each student will turn in their finished final project (100pts). 

#### Note: None of the assignments are particularly difficult, but they do require sufficient time to complete. Procrastination will kill you in this class.
To help discourage procrastination the weekly workload will be broken up so that there is something due ever few days, rather than having everythign due Sunday night each week. 

For example, chapter quizzes might be due on Wednesdays, weekly assignments might be due Fridays, and Case Studies might be due Sundays. If you are the type of student that likes to complete all your work on the weekends (because of work or family obligations) you will have to work ahead and turn assignments in early. 

## Policies
* Due dates will be posted in Canvas
* **Late work will not be accepted. Ever.**
  * I get it, students can get busy, forget, get sick, etc. But accepting late work is a huge hassle and is unfair to those who get their work turned in on time. So ... instead of accepting late work the lowest assignment grade will be dropped. That way if you miss an assignment because you're sick or you forgot, no worries. But if you habitually miss assignments your grade will suffer.
  * Exceptions may be made for a documented and approved medical absense. HOWEVER, the student is required to work with the Office of Access Services (not the instructor) to obtain an extension. 

## Special Needs
If you need course adaptations because of a disability or if you need an extension due to a documented medical absense, please provide the instructor with a Letter of Accomodation. To obtain a Letter of Accomodation, please visit the **Office of Access Services**, located in building 99 room 180.
